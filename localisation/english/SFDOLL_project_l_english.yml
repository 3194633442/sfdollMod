sfdoll_search_zion_event_0:"Mystery Signal"
sfdoll_search_zion_event_0_desc:"Recently, our researchers detected a unique signal. These signals are most likely related to earth relic technology. The content of the signal seems to point to an unknown planet."

site_noel_sfdoll_desc:0 "By parsing the mystery signal, we discovered the relics site. \n The planet where the relic is located has a high concentration of collapse particles and strong radiation on the surface. Even SF Dolls must use special equipment to act here. \n\n Under the action of the collapse particles, the creatures on the planet are transformed into ELID creatures, forming a biosphere different from ordinary organisms. \n\n The relic is constantly signaling outwards.We must go in and take a look."

sfdoll_search_zion_event.5_desc:0 "A large number of ELID creatures swarmed around the relic, and they attacked the expedition. \n These ELID creatures are like huge zombies, and their power has surpassed the common sense of creatures.

sfdoll_search_zion_event.8:0 "Proving Ground?"
sfdoll_search_zion_event.8_desc:0 "The silver-haired girl who appeared in the relics site was neither human nor autonomous doll. She is an artificial being, mixing characteristics of human and unknown species, named 'Noel'. \n\n Who built this place? Who sent the signal to bring us here? These questions are still unanswered, but the investigation of the ruins has brought a lot of valuable scientific research materials."

sfdoll_search_zion_event.9:0 "Taking in girl from relics site"
sfdoll_search_zion_event.9_desc:0 "We took the girl found in the ruins to our Research Facility.\n\n We found that in the girl's brain, there is a mind space similar to ours, which can send, receive and process data. \n\n The language she uses is similar to the Earth language. In her consciousness, words like sister seemed to be repeating all the time. \n We will continue to observe her."
